# What is this?
This is a simple python project that works with plotly's Dash framework to make a simple Dashboard. 

## Functionality
The dashboard will display a scatterplot with randomly generated numbers (both number count and range is selected by the user inside the dashboard).
The user is able to select desired points with rectangle or lasso tool, after which points that were selected will be displayed below the graph.

## How to run?
Simply download the random_plotter.py and run it with python. ( Don't forget to install required modules ;) )
